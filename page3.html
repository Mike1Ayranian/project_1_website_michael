<h1>Musique!</h1>
<h2>Albums</h2>
<p>Daft Punk has released several albums over the past years. Their albums include (in order from first to last) Homework, Discovery, Daft Club, Human After All, Musique Vol 1, Alive 2007 (Live Album), Tron: Legacy (Soundtrack), and Random Access Memories. Homework and Discovery were the first two albums they made which included the first original tracks the duo made together. The album Daft Club was an album that composed mostly of remixes that other people made of some of Daft Punk's songs. Human After All was another album that composed of original tracks the duo made, and Musique Vol 1 was an album that had some of their most popular songs from 1993 to 2005. Alive 2007 was Daft Punk's live album that they recorded while performing in the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy arena in Paris on June 14, 2007. Later, they made and released the soundtrack for the Movie Tron: Legacy in 2010 which compsoed of electronic and orchestra music. Random Access Memories as the most recent album the duo has made, which includes less electronic music and gives tribute to the 1970s and 80s era of music, that was played in disco's and places like that. The only electronic instruments they used were electronic drums, a custom-build modular synthesizer, and vintage vocoders. Out of the entire album, there was only one song that was completely electronically produced.</p>
<h2>Visuals</h2>
<p>Daft Punk is a musical artist, but in their live performances, they have had several stunning visuals. Even their iconic masks have intruiged several fans for years. Both Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel have their own helmets, but with almost each album they've released, they've had their mask come in different colors. In the Alive 2007 concert(s), Daft Punk had created a pyramid-like structure that had a large screen behind them and some lines of lights crossing around the pyramid. This structure was one of the most iconic structes, as it was one of its firsts for its era. Nobody had seen a performance like Daft Punk's before. One person called Zedd who has had a bit of influence from Daft Punk used a pyramid-like structure that was very similar to Daft Punk's. </p>
